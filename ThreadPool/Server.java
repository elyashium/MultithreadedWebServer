//this reduces the overhead of creating and destroying threads.
//this also reduces the overhead of context switching.

// If all 10 threads are busy handling other clients, the new task is placed in a queue. As soon as a thread finishes its current task, it will pick up the next task from the queue.
// The main server loop does not wait. It immediately loops back to accept() to listen for the next client. This ensures the server remains highly responsive.
